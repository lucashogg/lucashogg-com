## About

This is my portfolio website where you can view current and past projects. Creating this site was an exercise in learning and implementing React while maintaining a clean UI for overall accessibility.

After going through React's [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial to learn the basics, I utilized [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to set up my project and then went from there. Many, many React docs and Stack Overflow searches later, my portfolio site was complete... for now.

### Technologies

-   React/Javascript
-   CSS
-   HTML

### What I Learned

Well, a lot about the React framework, but still only scratching the surface I imagine. Since this website is (currently) only two pages, it was ideal for practicing how to structure a web app. Breaking each page into it's own component, and even individual sections of pages down to their respective components I could more neatly organize everything. This allowed me to essentially only build something once (eg, the Project.js component), fill out the relevant info via props (eg, in ProjectList.js), and then let that information dynamically populate in the HTML.
