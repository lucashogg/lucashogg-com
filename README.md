## About

This is my portfolio website where you can view current and past projects. Creating this site was an exercise in learning and implementing React while maintaining a clean UI for overall accessibility.

After going through React's [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial to learn the basics, I utilized [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to set up my project and then went from there. Many, many React docs and Stack Overflow searches later, my portfolio site was completed.
